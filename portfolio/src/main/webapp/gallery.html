      <h1>My Gallery</h1>
      <p>Photography is the way I capture moments of the world around me. Photos allow me to remmeber important moments and people by
         providing me with a reminder of them. Most of my photos fall into one of three categories. </p>
      <div id="topThird">
        <h3>Important Moments</h3>
        <div id="momentsDescrip">
          <p>These photos were originally taken in the moment without any thought, but looking back on them
           they are what will keep me from forgetting experiences that changed my life.</p>

          <p>Gracie is the family cat. She's seven years old and throughout those years she has never failed to
             be a great model for photographs. These are only a few of the many photos I have of her.</p>

        <h3>Drawing Inspiration</h3>
        <div id="inspoDescrip">
          <p>These are photos that may not look like much, but when I took then I was trying to capture an element
             of the environment that I wanted to incorporate into a drawing. Recently I have had more time to practice drawing
             and so these photos serve have been serving as inspiration for what I draw.</p>
